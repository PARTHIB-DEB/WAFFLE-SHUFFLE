# WAFFLE SHUFFLE (SHUFFLING OF BOXES) 

It is a mini project where user has to give two names of their favourite colours. Those names will go inside the cards and after several rounds of shuffling system will ask user to chose the right card for the asked colour. Though there are still some logical glitches, but it can be improved along more excellent features

This project is mostly based on vanilla JS
